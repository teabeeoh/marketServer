I am an investor and am interested in fundamental analysis based on annual financial statements and quarterly reports as well as news, analyst comments, and forum discussions. The following key figures are particularly important to me:

Growth companies that may not yet have reached the break-even point:
- Price/sales ratio
- Sales growth
- Free cash flow development
- Share growth and share buybacks
- Cash holdings and cash burn rate

Established companies:
- Free cash flow and its development
- If dividends are paid: dividend growth and coverage of dividends by free cash flow, dividend yield, and dividend growth
- Debt ratio

For all types of companies:

- Use of free cash flow for dividends, share buybacks, debt repayment, other
- (Negative) growth in free shares
- Director dealings: who has most recently bought or sold shares in this company?
